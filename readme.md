# "BarberShop" project

It's simple project "BarberShop", made by stack technologies: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript. The project
was made as part of my studies of markup with accessibility (a11y) features and improves UX-tricks.

At this state of project is saved feedback-form with simple css-tricks of field-validation - without
JavaScript-tricks.
